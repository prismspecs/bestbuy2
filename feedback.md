Hello Grayson

You've done a wonderful work.

Your code is very well structured and organized.

However I couldn't use the app due to some attribute errors as below:

- AttributeError: 'Product' object has no attribute 'show'

- AttributeError: 'Product' object has no attribute 'get_quantity'. Did you mean: '_quantity'?

Please refer to my comments in your code to start your troubleshooting.

I hope this helps and clarifies.

Best regards
